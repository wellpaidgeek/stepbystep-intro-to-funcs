/*
Task 1
------

Write a function called ‘logArgs’ that will take two arguments 
and log them to the console. 

The function should not return anything.

The call to console.log should first have the string
‘Called with’ (case sensitive) then the first argument,
and then the second argument.
*/



/*
Task 2
------

Do you remember our ecommerce company codes in the format
GSX-1345, GSX-7778 ect?

This is from back in the lecture about strings. If you’ll 
remember, we wrote code to extract the number part of the code.

Write a function ‘extractNumber’ which takes a single argument 
which is one of these codes as a string, extracts the number
part of the code and returns it as a number, not as a string
(the lecture on type coercion will help you here!).

For example:

extractNumber(‘GSX-444’); // returns 444
extractNumber(‘GSX-9867990’); // returns 9867990
